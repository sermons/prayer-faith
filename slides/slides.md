The next day as they were leaving Bethany, <br/>
Jesus was hungry.

<span class="ref">13</span>
Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, <br/>
he went to find out if it had any fruit.

<div class="ref">
Mark 11:12-13 (ESV) (p.1/5)
</div>

---
When he reached it,  <br/>
he found nothing but leaves, <br/>
because it was not the season for figs.

<span class="ref">14</span>
Then he said to the tree,  <br/>
“May no one ever eat fruit from you again.”

And his disciples heard him say it.

<span class="ref">20</span>
As they passed by in the morning, <br/>
they saw the fig tree <br/>
withered away to its roots.

<span class="ref">21</span>
And Peter remembered <br/>
and said to him, “Rabbi, look! <br/>
The fig tree that you cursed has withered.”

<div class="ref">
Mark 11:20-21 (ESV) (p.3/5)

And Jesus answered them, <br/>
“Have faith in God.

<span class="ref">23</span>
Truly, I say to you,  <br/>
whoever says to this mountain,  <br/>
Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’

and does not doubt in his heart,  <br/>
but believes that what he says  <br/>
will come to pass, it will be done for him.

Therefore I tell you,  <br/>
whatever you ask in prayer,  <br/>
believe that you have received it,  <br/>
and it will be yours.

<span class="ref">25</span>
And whenever you stand praying, forgive,  <br/>
if you have anything against anyone,

so that your Father also who is in heaven  <br/>
may forgive you your trespasses.”
